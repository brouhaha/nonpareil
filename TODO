TODO list for Nonpareil
Copyright 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005 Eric L. Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>
$Id$


Build process:

  Create an RPM .spec file.

    Should meet Fedora RPM guidelines:
    http://fedora.redhat.com/participate/developers-guide/ch-rpm-building.html

    "scons dist" should create the nonpareil.spec
    file from a template, so that "rpmbuild -tb" will work with the release
    tarball.


User interface:

  Printer
      plug/unplug (load/unload module)
      make mode switch a menu?
      power switch?
      automatic vertical scrolling to track end of tape when written
      handle closing window, provide way to reopen
      start "tape" at bottom of window
      save as (text, PNG, multi-column PDF)

  Replace use of GtkItemFactory (deprecated) with GTKUIManager.

  Make slide switches look better.

  Implement edit menu commands:
      Edit - Copy, Paste

  Make button highlighting look better.

  Add ability to read kml, image, microcode from zip file.
      GSF: http://www.gnome.org/projects/libgsf/
          examples in CVS: http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/libgsf/tests/
	  use a GdkPixbufLoader instead of gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file().
      On Windows, build ZIP into .EXE similar to a self-extractor?

  Transparency/shape: improve support for moving window: add KML
  syntax to specify keyboard rectangle, and use only region outside
  rectangle for dragging.

  Improve keyboard support:
      Release key when focus is lost.
      Ignore key release and hold key for a fixed (configurable?) number of
          simulation cycles?

  Add help.

  Create an icon.

  Calculator model selection at runtime.

  Create a fancier About box.  Use GtkAboutDialog, which allows for
  clickable website URLs and email addresses, license window, etc.

  Extract comments from image file and include in About box.  PNG
  comment keywords to use:
      Author
      Title
      Description
      Copyright
      Disclaimer
      Warning
      URL (unofficial)
  Unfortunately getting the comments will require the file to be
  read twice, once by gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(), and once by direct
  calls to libpng, libjpeg, etc.  Update: maybe can do parallel
  parsing on the fly, by reading the file myself and passing the
  data into a GdkPixbufLoader.


Internals:

  Change Phineas to store vars in binary, convert to BCD only for
      Nut read/write instructions

  Display improvements:
     Sim thread:
         Use io_count, etc. to improve display update timing.  (done in Nut.)
         Only send display update message to GUI thread if display has changed.

    Increase display update performance

      Pre-render digits/characters (compositing of segments) to increase
      display update performance.  Need 2**9 segment combinations for
      Voyager, 2**9 character/punctuation combinations for Coconut.  Note
      that this will require Coconut code to pass character code to GUI
      rather than segment map.

      Push pre-rendered digits/characters to X server (optional?) using
      GDK pixmaps.  Create offscreen pixmap from pixbuf with
      gdk_draw_pixbuf().  Use gdk_draw_drawable() to blit to display.


  Split proc.c into separate GUI thread and simulator thread portions.

  Create new XML-based ROM file format.

  Complete the support for -41C .mod files

  New memory API.

  Move more of the simulator initialization into the simulator thread.

  In csim.c, allow for multiple calculator instances.

  Use more of glib:

      file handling: g_build_filename(), g_stat()

      memory allocation/deallocation

      commandline option parser (g_option_xxx functions).  (glib 2.6)

  Add code to remove async queue g_source when simulator thread exits.


KML:

  It would be nice to use a pure parser for KML, pass in the kml_t
  pointer as input, and return it from read_kml_file().  But Flex
  doesn't yet seem to have support for the Bison pure_parser option.
  There exist patches, but I don't want to make people use those.
  Better to wait for a production release of Flex.

  Use XML files instead of KML?  (.nml?)


Assembler:

  Clean up memory usage of symbols in CASM

  Implement symbol cross-reference in CASM


Disassembler:

  Add disassembler for Classic processors.

  Make disassembler talk to sim thread rather than passing in two
  words as parameters.


Debugger:

  Make the register and memory windows update, and make changes get
  written back.  Disable editing (and grey out?) while running.

  Add debugger commands.  Pass dbt_t as arg to commands.

  Create new VTE patch based on feedback from Nalin.

  Change Tcl standard I/O streams to use pty file descriptor.

  Implement async queue based functions needed by debugger.


Better model support:

  Complete 41C Phineas (timer chip in Time Module/41CX).  Make stopwatch work
      (TESTB mode?)

  Add 41C HEPAX support.

  Scan images at uniform scale and without JPEG compression.

  Dump actual ROMs:
      Classic:    HP-45, HP-55, HP-65, HP-70, HP-80
      Classic/printing:  HP-46, HP-81, HP 9805A
      Woodstock:  HP-22, HP-27, HP-29C
      Topcat:     HP-91, HP-92, HP-95C, HP-97
      Sting:      HP-10, HP-19C
      Spice:      HP-31E, HP-33E
      Cricket:    HP-01

  Compare actual HP-45, HP-55, and HP-80 ROMs to CASM output.

  Add Woodstock microinstructions for card reader (HP-67, HP-97)

  Add Woodstock microinstructions for printer (HP-19C, HP-91, HP-92, HP-95C, HP-97)

  Add HP-65 microinstructions for program memory access.
